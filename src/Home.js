                <p className='font-roboto font-semibold'>Will and I first met in July 2016, when I was studying at Chester University and went to visit my mate Finn, who was studying at Aberystwyth and introduced me to his new mate Will, thinking we would be a perfect match! It tuned out Finn was right and we made our long distance relationship work until we both graduated in 2017 and moved in together a year later.

                We were on holiday in Amsterdam in June 2019, when Will proposed, down on one knee, on the Bridge of whatever. We were excited to make wedding plans and organized our big family wedding for August 2020.

                The start of 2020 was nothing like any of us could have imagined and our hopes of having the dream wedding we had planned were dashed. We have waited so long for the pandemic to end and for life to return to normal, but we are still living with enormous uncertainty. So, we decided to live with the current restrictions and look forward to a smaller celebration on Saturday 12th June.

                Whilst we will miss so many family and friends not being with us on the day, we hope you enjoy the video and photos and hope we will be able to see you all again soon.

                        Love from Emily & Will x</p>
